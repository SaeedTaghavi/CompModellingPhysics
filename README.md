# CompModellingPhysics


Lecture notes and computational exercises for the "Computational Modelling in Physics" module at QUB (PHY1024).

This is the version I used for my teaching in spring 2016.

Note: First half of this module was taught by my colleague Alan, using C (not Python). Assignments no. 1 and 2 were the C assignments (not included in this repo).
