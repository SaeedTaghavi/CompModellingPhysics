These should be emailed as attachments to k.poppenhaeger@qub.ac.uk, with the subject given as your name and student number.

    "*Background:* We often do error propagation in physics. Let's say we want to add two numbers we have measured in the lab somehow, and each of those numbers has a measurement error (standard deviation):\n",

    "1d) Make a matplotlib plot of the three arrays (M, L, and R), using the element number on the x axis and the values stored in the array on the y axis. Switch connecting lines off and use small marker symbols by using '.' in the plotting command, as in \"plt.plot(xxxxxx, xxxxxxx, '.')\". Use 3 different colors for the arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "1e) Make a matplotlib plot of the *histograms* of M, L, and R (three histograms in the same plot). Use 100 bins for each array in the plot. You can set the option \"alpha=0.5\" at the end of the plt.hist command, like this: plt.hist(mydata, bins=mynumberofbins, alpha=0.5), to make each histogram slightly transparent. This will prevent the histograms from completely blocking out parts of the previously plotted histgrams. \n",
